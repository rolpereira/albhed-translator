This is a small [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) webpage that allows the translation from English to the [Al-bhed](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Al_Bhed) language.

You can find an example running in Heroku [here](http://albhed-translator.herokuapp.com/).


## Al-bhed ##

Al-bhed is a fictional language from the video game [Final Fantasy X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_X), released in 2001.

It basically works as a substitution cipher. For example, the letter `A` is replaced with the letter `Y`.
